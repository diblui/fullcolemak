# Full International Colemak layout

## for physical keyboards on Android



### Why

After trying to use the built-in Colemak layout on Android, I discovered it did not have any of the International key.

So I built it myself! :)

### How to use it

- Install
- Select layout from Android Keyboard settings or when prompted after connecting a keyboard
- Enjoy!

### Disclamer

I am not a programmer and don't really know what I did to do this. I followed some code found online and from the android source code itself. 

This app does not have any real code apart from a single, empty placeholder class that does nothing.
